# GCSE-Computer-Science-Project
# Programming Langage Used: Python
# This is my completed GSCE Computer Science project in which I scored an A* in.
# We were assigned three tasks
# 1. Create a program that enabled students to practice arithmentic skills
# 2. Following on from this we had to adapt the program to allow a teacher to keep track of scores students recieved from running the above program
# 3. For this stage were then made to conduct some basic data processing. To store the students scores in alphabetic order and to store the scores by the score of a student.

# This was my first time using python and when I fell in love with programming.
