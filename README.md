# GCSE-Computer-Science-Project 

# Programming Language Used: Python 

# This is my completed GSCE Computer Science project in which I scored an A* in. 

# We were assigned three tasks 

# 1. Create a program that enabled students to practice their arithmetic skills 

# 2. Following on from this we had to adapt the program to allow a teacher to keep track of the score's students received from running the above program 

# 3. For this stage we were then made to conduct some basic data processing. To store the students' scores in alphabetic order and to store the data by the score of a student. 

  

# This was my first-time using python and when I fell in love with programming.
